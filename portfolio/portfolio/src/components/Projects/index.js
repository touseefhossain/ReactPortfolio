                    Here are some projects I've done in school that required a bit more than just 
                    a "design, then implement" type of process.

                    <h4><i>Data Visualization Project</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        For my DataVis class, we (my groupmates and I) were given the task of creating 
                        a data-driven narrative that provided insight/answers on issues that concerned 
                        a certain demographic. This project spanned over the entire semester and 
                        required numerous tasks in order to complete it. Our group decided to look into 
                        student's screen time on a day-to-day basis to see what it is used for and how 
                        it could potentially be used more productively. We felt this could give great 
                        insight to students on how they can study better. <br/><br/>
                        As an outline for all the major tasks we had to accomplish, we:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Collected personal data on our screen time (consisted of numerous data 
                            attributes such as length of time and physical environment)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Compiled and cleaned the collective data to ensure the data is relatively 
                            consistent (done manually first, then on Jupyter Notebook, Python)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed some data visualizations on Jupyter Notebook using Python 
                            libraries: pandas and plotly
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Write out a narrative to compliment the visualizations along with draw 
                            out some conclusions that could potentially provide some use for students
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Below are some snippets of the code and narrative that we ended up with. The 
                        original source code is harder to extract since my Jupyter Notebook account 
                        has been terminated (school account). If you are interested in seeing the

                    <h4><i>Capstone Project with CP Railway</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        For my final year at UofC, I had the honour of working with Canadian Pacific 
                        Railway (CP Rail) for my year-long capstone project. Our (my group and I) 
                        clients over there tasked us with building a system that is able to replicate 
                        real live track. The second big aspect of the system is that there needed to 
                        be a way for a train simulation to run on said replicated track. The two 
                        requirements needed to be broken down into electrical and software components, 
                        where I took the lead role for the software side. Our final design was a PCB 
                        system where each PCB board represented 1000 feet for track and an Arduino 
                        system (primarily programmed in C) that sent signals along the track, 
                        simulating a train running on a track. For a better and more in-depth 
                        explanation, check out the video made by one of my groupmates.

                        With this project, I was involved with the entire product development
                        experience, including steps such as communicating with the client and testing 
                        in a controlled lab setting. Overall, the project was a success and I was 
                        able to learn a lot from the experience. Unfortunately, if you are curious 
                        about the code I've written for the UI or the simulation process, I am not 
                        able to share it as it is now CP Railway's intellectual property.

                <p className='header-text'>
                    Outside of school, I have developed some personal projects in order to tackle 
                    new coding territory that was not covered in my undergrad degree. What motivates 
                    me to continue with developing new projects is my zeal to learn new concepts and 
                    to have little fun while developing things that I wanted to make.

                    <h4><i>Recreational Website Project</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        Froggy is a website I made in order to learn the HTML syntax and CSS language. 
                        There are some small components of JavaScript and PHP in there, but I wouldn't 
                        say that I am well-versed in those languages after completing the website. This 
                        website is dedicated to frogs and keeping them as a pet. I got the idea from a 
                        colleague at work. Frog care is a field I was unfamiliar with and my coworker 
                        inspired me to research more into it. Hence, I developed a passion project 
                        website to deliver my findings. Here are 
                        some snippets of the website below.

                        developed a more creative mindset through working on this website (my first 
                        one, by the way), in the sense that I am more confident in my stylistic 
                        choices. To see the source code, feel free to check on my GitHub. <br/>

                    <h4><i>Pygame-Based Project</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        Python is a language that was not heavily covered in my undergraduate studies 
                        so I took it upon myself to truly learn its syntax 
                        and features with this next personal project of mine: RunningToast. This is a 
                        simple game I developed using the PyGame library. Similar to the dinosaur 
                        running game found on the Google search engine (when there is no internet), 
                        RunningToast is a straightforward game where the player needs to jump over 
                        obstacles in order to gain points. The sprites and animations were crafted 
                        by yours truly (made sprite sheets on Piskel), and the game includes multiple 
                        phase screens and background music (from some of my favourite medium). click 
                        the link under the screenshot to play the game.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Although it's simple in concept, I made sure 
                        the game was developed in a way in which there are no bugs (as far as I know), 
                        and that it is scalable. The practices I used to make it so were from 
                        my studies, which made me feel proud that I was able to apply theory into an 
                        actual software application. The source code can be found and downloaded 
                        from my GitHub account, so feel free to take a look there. <br/>

                        This very website is also what I consider a personal project!
                        I have learned that ReactJS is a very popular frontend network for web design 
                        and other applications. I thought it would be a good idea to familiarize myself 
                        with ReactJS along with get more practice with JavaScript by developing my own 
                        personal portfolio website. I also used the EmailJS service to help with 
                        creating a level of interaction with the website, which you can find on the 
                        'Contact' page. Look around the website, and let me know if you have any 
                        feedback!
